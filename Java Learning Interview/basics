interface..

Interface can possess public,default,abstract.

Method:
The interface body can contain "abstract methods, default methods, and static methods".

	An abstract method within an interface is followed by a semicolon, but no braces (an abstract method does not contain an implementation).
	Default methods are defined with the default modifier, and static methods with the static keyword. 

	Note for Method: All abstract, default, and static methods in an interface are implicitly public, so you can omit the public modifier.
Constant:
	Note for constant : In addition, an interface can contain constant declarations. All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly "public, static, and final". Once again, you can omit these modifiers.
