Q) What is the difference between equals() and == ?

First, “==” is an operator whereas equals() is a method. We use == operator for reference comparison (or address comparison) and equals() method for content comparison. It means that == checks if both objects point to the same memory location while equals() compares values in the objects.

Q)  Can we execute a program without main() method?

Many java basic interview questions are really easy. Like this one. So short answer is: yes, we can. For example we can do it using static block.

You can use static block to initialize the static data member. It is executed before the main method, at the time of class loading.

What about total main method absence? If you try to run an ordinary class without the main method at all, you got the next error: Main method not found in class Test, please define the main method as: public static void main (String [] args) or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application. The error itself says that if this is a JavaFX application and the class is inherited from javafx.application.Application, then it is possible.
