Collection is an in-memoery data-structure to hold values.
Java Stream is a data structure that is computed on-demand.

In formal way we have using external iteration way to iterate any collection.

While with stream internal iteration provide 
Sequential and parallel execution,
filtering
mapping

Java Stream Api mostly work with "Functional interface" and "Lambda expression".

1) Java stream is consumable (Nor we can store nor we can make reference).

2) we can use primitive data types such as int, long in the collections using auto-boxing and these operations could take a lot of time, there are specific classes for primitive types â€“ "IntStream, LongStream and DoubleStream ".
